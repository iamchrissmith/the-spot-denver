    <td> 
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The original 
        motivation to create &quot;a place&quot; came from the frustration of 
        working with &quot;high risk&quot; urban adolescents and having no place 
        in Denver that welcomed them during the hours that were relevant to them, 
        and that was accessible, safe, and fun. Their kind of fun. For 9 months 
        in 1993 and 1994 we searched for space. We spoke to over 90 property owners 
        including churches, schools, store fronts, warehouses, etc. Some were 
        too deep in a gang territory, which would limit the participation of youth 
        from other neighborhoods or gangs. Most were simply unavailable due to 
        adults' fear of and apathy toward our clientele. The churches didn't want 
        to risk scaring away any of their paying older members. The schools didn't 
        want to challenge their administrative rules. Even when we agreed to pay 
        advertised lease rates, we were constantly rejected. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally 
        we set a &quot;drop dead date&quot; of early June, 1994. We had to have 
        something, even a garage if need be, before the start of another violent 
        summer. When time really got short we approached a friend, local nonprofit 
        director Jess Willis of the Curtis Park Community Center. He graciously 
        agreed to allow us to use two adjacent rooms that opened to the street 
        about 10 blocks from downtown Denver.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/graphics/history_thespot1.jpg" width="250" height="161" align="right" alt="The First Site of The Spot Youth Center">The 
        facility was small (maybe 700 SF). It was deep in Crip gang territory. 
        And, it was only available for the summer months. No matter! It was free. 
        It was a start. Three nights per week from about 6 PM to 9 PM. Two over 
        stuffed chairs. A huge donated bean bag chair. A table with my tiny TV 
        and my floppy disk computer. Our only software was Reader Rabbit and Math 
        Blaster. A Mr. Coffee bought at Goodwill. Not exactly a teenage mecca. 
        Our clientele were mostly younger neighborhood kids. Some older youth 
        we knew dropped by occasionally, but there was little for them to do, 
        and the younger kids drove them crazy (me, too).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The real 
        founders of what was to become The Spot youth center was a group of teens 
        who made up the Com'n On Strong grant making group: Jackson, Kim, Duane, 
        Mandy, Milk, Tanika, Esteban, Sharon, and Erma Lisa.. We had gotten a 
        $15,000 grant from some local families (members of the Charter Fund) who 
        agreed to allow the youth to select the nonprofit recipients. This group 
        also chose the name, &quot;The Spot&quot;, after much spirited debate. 
        We took a risk in allowing this name, because at the time &quot;The Spot&quot; 
        was a common name for any place you could go to buy crack cocaine. But, 
        as usual, the youth were right. It's turned out to be a great name.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September 
        of '94 was a huge month for our youth center. One day driving down Stout 
        Street as it emerged from downtown I saw a &quot;For Lease&quot;sign on 
        an abandoned industrial building. The sign had gone up that day and I 
        got a tour later that afternoon. The owner, John McCusker, was the first 
        property owner who said &quot;maybe&quot; to our proposal for a youth 
        center. That &quot;maybe&quot; was all we needed. We soon convinced him 
        that we were low maintenance, with no need for renovations, and we'd cover 
        his monthly expenses. We signed a two year lease for this 10,000 SF bi-level 
        building at about $1500/month rent. Signing that lease scared the hell 
        out of me. Later that same week we learned that we were awarded our first 
        grant, which we applied for back in June, for approximately $25,000 from 
        the state's Youth Crime Prevention and Intervention (YCPI) fund. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="/graphics/history_thespot2.jpg" width="240" height="136" align="left" alt="The Spot Youth Center at 2039 Stout st.">The 
        building was in horrible shape. Only about 7,000 SF was useable (due to 
        constant sewer backups in the basement). Employees from Phil Long Ford 
        donated a truckload of used office furniture and their sweat to help put 
        a dent in 10 years of dust, dirt, dead things, and other crud. Financially 
        it was going to be very tight. To make ends meet I lived out of the basement 
        for 6 months. After the third time the sewer backed up into my &quot;no 
        natural light or sound&quot; room, it was time to move out and into an 
        apartment. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the 
        business and financial side, it all started with Jim Bye, a well known 
        and respected attorney with the Holmes Roberts & Owen law firm. I had 
        many ideas in the spring of 1993, and Jim offered me some invaluable advice: 
        &quot;Start with one simple idea and do it well&quot;. He also introduced 
        me to many others. His partner Don Hopkins helped us through the state's 
        incorporation and bylaws process, and wrote the IRS application documents 
        for our 501-C3. Don also advised us to get an independent audit every 
        year (which we have wisely done from the start). Colleagues of Jim's, 
        Ron Williams and Sam Gary of Gary Williams Energy Corp. and the Piton 
        Foundation, agreed to contract my services in a way that allowed me to 
        invest my full time into this project. To this day they are still our 
        youth center's biggest and most loyal corporate/individual sponsor. Their 
        Senior Vice President, Dave Younggren eventually became our Board chairperson. 
        Rich Rainaldi, formerly of the Piton Foundation and now with U.S. Bank, 
        was our day to day contact with Piton. In June '94 we submitted our first 
        written grant proposal to the fledgling Youth Crime Prevention and Intervention 
        (YCPI) fund in the Department of Local Affairs of Colorado Governor Roy 
        Romer's office. As mentioned above, in September '94 we were awarded a 
        $25,000 grant. A dynamic and visionary Coloradoan, who was a respected 
        state legislator named Tony Grampsas, along with Colorado Children's Campaign 
        director Barbara O'Brien, created the YCPI grassroots state funded pool. 
        Tony has since passed away, yet we will always remember and be grateful 
        for his caring, courage and follow through. The Spot would not exist without 
        Tony G! Members of the Charter Fund, a group of charitable family foundations 
        coordinated by the Piton Foundation, stepped to the plate to begin covering 
        many of our operating costs. Our first employee was Kim Reagan whose part-time 
        pay was covered by Noel & Tom Congdon, local oil people and philanthropists. 
        Tony and Delisa Mayer, along with Tony's parents' Fred and Jan Mayer, 
        were some of our earliest investors. Hal and Ann Logan were introduced 
        to us by the Mayers. Doak Jacoway, a personal mentor and fellow Sigma 
        Chi, was there to cover many months of our start-up's needs. Other friends 
        such as Kathy French introduced us to colleagues at the Denver Leadership 
        Forum. One of those was Mary Easterday, who became one of our youth center's 
        founding &quot;advisory board&quot; members. Soon to follow were Kelly 
        & Tim Root, and Diane & John Leede. Every one of our earliest investors 
        listed above are still our staunchest supporters. In hind sight, I don't 
        find it a coincidence that many of these investors are business people 
        involved with higher risk businesses of their own such as oil, investments, 
        cable, and entrepreneurial ventures. Through their own business experiences 
        they have learned that it is usually necessary to make higher risk investments 
        if you want to achieve higher returns. It's no different with youth and 
        The Spot youth center. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of 
        Don Hopkins' suggestions was to wait until we built a solid track record 
        before we asked people to formally join a Board of Directors, with its 
        accompanying fiduciary responsibilities. Our night time project for older 
        youth, who come from many different neighborhoods and gangs, was rightfully 
        perceived as &quot;rather risky&quot;. We initially agreed to have the 
        minimum of 2 board members. I was President and Don Hopkins agreed to 
        be Secretary. Don was and is a courageous (and maybe crazy) person. We 
        simultaneously developed a less formal &quot;advisory board&quot; of people 
        who believed in the concept of The Spot youth center. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, we 
        had some money, we had a place, and we had some street wise youth involved. 
        Build it and they will come! Right? Wrong! Some came, but they didn't 
        stay. And they didn't come back. It was boring! That's when Ms. Reggie 
        Huerter, former staff with Denver Partners, adult advisor for GRASP (Gang 
        Rescue and Support Project), and founder/director of the Denver District 
        Attorney's Juvenile Diversion Program came to our rescue (although not 
        for the first or last time). She offered us some simple yet effective 
        advice. &quot;Find the right leader youth and ask them what to do!&quot; 
        Duh! She suggested Delfino &quot;Fienz&quot; Rodriquez, a well known (on 
        the street) b-boy (i.e. graffiti artist, breakdancer, and rapper). He 
        and his soon to be wife came and had lunch and looked over the almost 
        empty Spot. He pointed to the blank walls and asked us to buy some Krylon 
        spray paint and allow graf murals. He pointed to the old hard carpet on 
        the basement floor and suggested two 10' strips of linoleum fastened to 
        the floor with carpet tape (available at any larger hardware store)Öthe 
        perfect breakdancing surface. He asked us to buy a good and powerful boombox 
        for the music (youth would bring their own CD's). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank 
        you Regina and Fienz! The Spot youth center and its Hip Hop roots were 
        born!!. Every time we've provided more space, staff, equipment, supplies, 
        computers, etc. for our youth to express their talents in the elements 
        of the Hip Hop culture, more urban adolescents have found us and consistently 
        returned. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other 
        than Kim, our earliest employees were AmeriCorps members. This domestic 
        &quot;Peace Corps&quot; gave us access to skilled and dedicated people 
        at almost no cost. In the birthing stages of a small business like The 
        Spot youth center, dependable and affordable human resources are crucial 
        to success. Our very first AmeriCorps members were Francine and Cedric. 
        Both were in prison when we met. They soon got out and I hired them. Both 
        did a good job of outreaching and relating to the challenged youth we 
        sought as participants. Later, we had other AmeriCorps members. One of 
        them became my wife, Peggy. When Peggy first joined me, 2 hours after 
        our first lunch date, to visit a small building that formerly was a head 
        shop (for those out of touch a head shop is a store that sells marijuana 
        paraphernalia) as a possible site for The Spot youth center. Peggy played 
        a huge role in co-founding The Spot, and becoming a mentor and friend 
        to many of our participants. Julie Darby, an AmeriCorps member taking 
        a sabbatical from her graphic art career, and Peggy soon created our youth 
        magazine. Julie also created our first graphics/desktop publishing computer 
        station and our original logo with the name &quot;The Spot&quot;. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        were so many graffiti artists that nightly brought their sketchbooks filled 
        with unreal drawings, photos, and paintings. There were so many gang bangers 
        and homeless youth with street real written and spoken poems and raps. 
        It became imperative to show the &quot;outside world&quot; these kids' 
        creative talent. This talent and their reality deserved recognition. Our 
        emerging publication needed a name. Like every name we create, the youth 
        do the creating. During a late night basement brain storming session, 
        Bumpy and Aaron proposed the name, Inner 303. &quot;Inner&quot; stands 
        for both the &quot;inner city&quot;and the &quot;inner journey&quot;. 
        &quot;303&quot; is tagger language used with graffiti sprayed on the outside 
        of train cars that travels the country. Just like with train graffiti, 
        the artists include their home telephone area code next to their signature, 
        which lets others around the world know the origin of the work (303 is 
        the area code for Denver).</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In the 
        early days our founders and many of our participants were gang members, 
        homeless youth, gay/lesbian/bi youth, graffiti artists, b-boys, etc. These 
        are the groups of youth that nobody wanted near them (still the case today!). 
        These are youth who often endured and dished out violence. The risky behaviors 
        of many of these youth frequently spilled over into The Spot youth center, 
        and our staff became very adept at recognizing and diffusing conflicts 
        and violence. The old heads will never forget the night that the Denver 
        Police SWAT team had the place surrounded due to the presence of a young 
        woman who had just kidnapped a baby from the hospital. Fortunately to 
        this day we have never had anyone seriously hurt at The Spot youth center 
        by a weapon (knock on wood). Especially during the first two years conflict 
        was every night, and more than once per night. One of the greatest gifts 
        our staff has offered our youth is the opportunity to squash conflict 
        in a respectful manner. We continue to evolve and we now attract a group 
        of urban youth who continue to face many challenges, but are most often 
        looking to maintain a peaceful and respectful environment. Conflicts still 
        occur frequently, but are less often accompanied by violence.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Working 
        on the street with youth you learn early that there's one main code that 
        rules the street --RESPECT! Because it's the street code of conduct for 
        our youth, it has always been and always will be the code of The Spot 
        youth center. All staff, volunteers, and youth are expected to demonstrate 
        respectful behavior toward each other at all times. Without it, safety 
        cannot exist. Without a safe place, nothing else can be accomplished. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 
        the beginning we wanted to provide a positive and safe alternative on 
        Friday and Saturday evenings. Once we had enough staff and volunteers 
        to commit to 5 nights a week we were open Tuesday - Saturday. For the 
        first two and a half years this was our schedule. Problem! We got many 
        more youth participating on weekday nights than on weekend nights. Even 
        when we created a dance club atmosphere on weekend nights we couldn't 
        compete with the commercial nightclubs and house parties. Our high school 
        age and older youth wanted a totally social environment with access to 
        alcohol and more on the weekends. We quickly found that a nightclub was 
        not our cup of tea. We stubbornly hung onto the weekend nights until we 
        could no longer justify the staff expenditure for so few attending youth. 
        Finally we asked the youth which 5 nights per week they'd utilize The 
        Spot youth center most. They told us, and thus our schedule is Sunday 
        - Thursday. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our youth 
        center's hours of operation quickly became and have remained 5:30 PM - 
        10:30 PM. We wanted to provide services to our youth when little else 
        was available and when they really wanted and needed it. Yet, we did not 
        want to expose our under 18 year old population to the risk of being out 
        after curfew (11:00 PM). Since curfew violations can include traveling, 
        we decided to shut down our program each night at 10:30 PM. This at least 
        offered our youth a running start toward home (assuming they have one). 
        It also allowed the staff to do clean up, write our nightly report, secure 
        the building, and head home before midnight. We then worked backwards 
        on the clock to determine when we should open. After school hours are 
        important, but we did not have enough staff and resources to be open for 
        8 hours per night. We also found that our staff can offer a lot of emotional 
        and physical energy to our youth when the nightly program is limited to 
        5 hrs/night. With 5 hrs/night dedicated to program, that allows some quality 
        time, 3 hours/afternoon (approximately 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM), to conduct 
        return calls, follow-up on referrals, plan, train, and participate with 
        other community organizations. All of these more daytime duties are necessary 
        to being an effective and professional youth serving staff person. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997 
        it became glaringly clear that the escalating downtown real estate lease 
        and purchase prices were going to eventually price us out of the downtown 
        market. Since our downtown location was and is so critical to our success 
        (i.e. gang neutral and easy public transportation access), our board decided 
        to bite the bullet and purchase our own place. Luckily we were able to 
        buy a building that was only 1 block away that required very little immediate 
        alternation. Our new and current building was built in 1936 for Paramount 
        Studios as a film screening facility. The layout and many attributes of 
        this 9,500 SF building are not ideal for a youth center (e.g. two floors 
        with no elevator), but we have adapted to each other and are co-existing 
        nicely. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        are two major groups of people who deserve the most credit for giving 
        birth to The Spot youth center: our youth and staff/volunteers. The lists 
        below only offers first names and nick names in order to preserve some 
        sense of privacy. Only the &quot;old heads&quot; have been listed. Please 
        let us know if we've missed some key names. To those who gave The Spot 
        youth center their time and energy in those early days. THANK YOU! We 
        hope you're proud of your role! We hope The Spot has made your life better!
