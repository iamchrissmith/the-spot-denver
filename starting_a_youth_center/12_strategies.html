          youth market</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          With whom do you most enjoy interacting? Who most needs and would use 
          a center? Who is already serving your market and how? What unique niche 
          will you fill? Your most important source for answers are your target 
          youth. Ask them! Involve them everywhere you can. Consider very strongly 
          their advice, but because this is a business, somebody has to make timely 
          judgments and decisions. That's you. You must balance a welcome/open 
          environment with a focused appeal. You need buy-in, but not exclusivity. 
          With limited resources you can't serve everybody, so narrow your market 
          (i.e. age, music, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, "good" vs. 
          "bad", etc.).<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF"><b><br>
          <font color="#CCCCFF">Recruiting</font></b></font>: This will largely 
          happen by word of mouth (youth to youth) Chose two or three key leader 
          youth from your target market and allow them to make activity and facility 
          use recommendations. Give their ideas space, supplies, equipment, etc.<br>
          <br>
          <b><font color="#CCCCFF">Age Limits</font></b>: If you want to serve 
          youth in the high school age group or higher, you must have separate 
          space (and lots of it) exclusively for them. It is simply not cool to 
          hang out with younger kids. Having a lower age limit of approximately 
          14 yrs. (freshman in high school) is a natural cut-off. Also, do not 
          separate artificially at ages 18 and 21. While these are landmark ages 
          for schools, alcohol, grants, courts, etc. it is better to allow up 
          to approximately age 24. These age groups usually interact well, but 
          keeping an eye on older guys hitting on younger girls is a must. The 
          challenges and opportunities of this adolescent age group are unique 
          and deserve all the resources your program and staff can muster. <br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC00CC" size="2"><b>Site</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          Seek the ideal location and building, but set a start date and settle 
          for the best site available on that start date (even if it's your garage). 
          Location: safe (gang neutral, little traffic, etc.); public transportation 
          and parking very close; neighbors compatible with hours of operation 
          and sometimes loud activities. If a good investment, buy. <br>
          <br>
          Building: big enough and open layout to allow many youth with differing 
          interests. Prefer all space to be on ground floor for easier supervision. 
          Dependable heating/air conditioning and plumbing are a must. (If it's 
          too uncomfortable, nobody stays).<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#CC00CC">Supervision</font></b><br>
          As an individual or group you may not have "training or credentials." 
          So what! You can and should create this, but volunteers and older youth 
          should only be used for initial start-up or to enhance the operation. 
          Generally, volunteers are not dependable enough for the consistency 
          youth need. As soon as possible hire professionally paid, trained, and 
          respectful adult staff (this does not mean they need a PhD).<br>
          <font color="#CC00CC"><br>
          </font></font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC00CC" size="2"><b>Hours 
          / days of operation</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          Your priority should be the needs and habits of the youth, not the desires 
          of adults. After school hours and into the late night hours are when 
          most youth crime occur and when youth will attend your center. Weekend 
          nights will depend on your willingness and ability to provide the highly 
          social party or dance type activities.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660099" size="2"><b><font color="#CC00CC">Activities</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          It's fine to have a safe and accessible place, but kids will get bored 
          and leave if there's little to do that they find interesting. Observe 
          and ask what youth are already doing and have an interest in. Provide 
          space, equipment/supplies, "coaching," and progressive challenges. Balance 
          fun with focused activities. Be willing to take risks with activities 
          you may not understand (e.g. rap music, breakdancing, graffiti murals, 
          etc.).<br>
          <font color="#CC00CC"><br>
          </font></font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CC00CC" size="2"><b>Rules 
          and Restrictions</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          Adolescents generally know what's acceptable and what's not. Have youth 
          determine the few key expectations needed to maintain safety and respect, 
          and the consequences for inappropriate behavior. Keep "rules" either 
          out of sight or posted to a minimum. Ask youth to comply when behavior 
          is inappropriate and respectfully explain why inappropriate. Crisis 
          may call for more assertiveness, but it can still be done with maximum 
          respect. Apply consequences fairly and consistently. Do not exclude 
          youth affiliated with a specific group (e.g. gang, tagging crew, etc.). 
          If their behavior is unsafe or disrespectful, invite them to return 
          when their behavior changes. <br>
          <br>
          Do not require an I.D. to enter and participate, unless you create and 
          file the I.D.'s at your center.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#660099" size="2"><b><font color="#CC00CC">Equipment 
          and furniture</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          Get the best and try to buy new. Not only do youth deserve it, but new 
          lasts longer and comes with warranties and manuals. Donated/used is 
          OK, but are often flawed, so check it out before you accept delivery.<br>
          <br>
          </font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#CC00CC">Insurance</font></b><br>
          General liability, officer's & director's liability, and building hazard 
          insurances are commercially available and not that expensive. You will 
          not be able to insure or waiver-protect every youth activity. Please 
          do not let the excuse of "liability" stand in the way of providing relevant 
          youth alternatives.<br>
          <br>

              as soon as possible with federal IRS (501-C3 nonprofit), state, 
              and city. You can do this yourself, but it helps to have an attorney.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Get copies 
              of other nonprofits' annual reports to find out who is donating 
              money. Call those organizations/people and find out if your program 
              qualifies and how to apply. Some states have a statewide association 
              of nonprofit organizations or publish a guide to local charitable 
              givers. Start calling.<br>

          From the very first day and night keep track of what's happening. Maintain 
          the discipline to do this every night. We suggest the following minimum 
          records to get started:<br>

              Count: For small centers a sign-in sheet can work well, but eventually 
              youth will ignore it and it's too expensive to have staff baby-sit 
              it. Another choice is to do a walk-through count twice per night, 
              and then correlate those numbers to occasional sign-in numbers.<br>
