      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b><i><font color="#CCCCFF" size="3">Dave, 
        why did you start doing this?</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Only my therapist can accurately answer this one. If you'd 
        like the long answer please see the <a href="/general_info/staff.html">Staff</a> 
        page for my biography and The Spot <a href="/general_info/history.html">History</a> 
        page for a description of how we got started. The short answer is that 
        I have experienced a variety of careers and industries, yet along the 
        way I have found nothing that makes me feel more significant than working 
        to create The Spot. Combine this with a very deep knowledge of what it's 
        like to grow up a lonely fatherless boy and enduring a traumatic divorce 
        in the late '80s which eventually caused my own son and daughter to move 
        out of state, and you will have the bulk of "why" I started and continue 
        to help create The Spot. Oh, let's also not forget that I didn't see anyone 
        else doing it the way the urban adolescents wanted and needed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#CCCCFF">How 
        did The Spot get started?</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please see The Spot's 
        <a href="/general_info/history.html">History</a> page.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCFF" size="3">Do 
        you own your building? How big is the building?</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1994 The Spot was 
        born in two adjacent rooms that opened to the street. The Curtis Park 
        Community Center let us borrow this space for free for the summer. We 
        then found an abandoned building that the owner wanted to lease with no 
        renovations. It was a bi-level warehouse-type building of 10,000 s.f. 
        (only 7,000 s.f. useable) which we leased for 2 years for $1100-1500/month. 
        This is where things really started happening. Our need to stay downtown 
        in an escalating rental market caused us to buy our current building (with 
        the help of a loan from U.S. Bank) in 1997. It's 9,500 s.f. on 2 stories 
        only 1 block away from the previous site and was originally built in 1936 
        as a Paramount Studios film screening facility. We have purchased an &quot;Annex&quot; 
        building just across the street. It contains 6,250 s.f. of space and will 
        be home to our <a href="/education_and_career/ged.html">GED</a> and <a href="/education_and_career/aplus_certification.html">A+</a> 
        programs, as well as adminstrative offices and possibly an outreach office 
        for a partner organization <a href="http://www.urbanpeak.org" target="_blank">Urban 
        Peak</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i><font size="3" color="#CCCCFF">Where 
        does your money come from?</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">People and organizations 
        that don't fear, or don't fear as much as others, investing in risk (see 
        our <a href="/general_info/history.html">History</a> page for more details 
        about our original funders). Our first investors were (and fortunately 
        still are) oil company executives who believe in the high return of investing 
        in risk. Our first written grant proposal was made to the State of Colorado's 
        brand new youth crime prevention and intervention grant fund in 1994. 
        We asked for $80,000 and they gave us about $24,000. Here's last fiscal 
        year's breakdown of our sources of our revenue:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">State government 
          30%</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Foundation 28%</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corporate 27%</font></li>

        <li><font size="2">Civic 2%</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Other (earned, interest, etc.) 3%</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
          </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b><font size="3" color="#CCCCFF">What 
        was and is your annual budget?</font></b></i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the first year 
        of our existence, 1994, our budget was under $26,000/year. This current 
        operating year budget is $784,000. A rough breakdown is as follows: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Personnel (salary 
        & benefits; 11 FTE, 1 Part, 1 Contract): $456,000 (58%)<br>
        Supplies and Projects: $157,000 (20%)<br>
        Utiliites, Insurance, Phone, Mortgage: $170,000 (22%)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><i><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#CCCCFF">What 
        staff did you start with and what do you have now?</font></b></i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We started with some 
        volunteers and myself: Peggy (my wife to be) and key young people like 
        Kim Reagan (homeless at the time) and Louis Jackson ("gang" affiliated 
        at the time). We now have 9 fulltime employees and 1 part-time contract 
        employee (see <a href="/general_info/staff.html">Staff</a> page).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#CCCCFF">Who's 
        on your board of directors?</font></i></b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The perceived risk 
        of this night time place that was going to invite older youth from many 
        neighborhoods, backgrounds, and gang affiliations was too high to ask 
        our supporters to join a board of directors. For the first two and a half 
        years we only had a very brave and talented non-profit attorney, Don Hopkins, 
        and myself with Holme Roberts & Owen. Don had written our initial incorporation 
        and IRS documents, and participated in one of our first Inner Reality 
        excursions. Over the initial couple of years we were able to prove that 
        while conflict was frequent, actual violence was minimal. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We now have 12 board 
        members, including myself (see <a href="/general_info/board_of_directors.html">Board 
        of Directors</a> page). They are an extremely active and passionate group 
        that meets once per month. Two of our youth participants are full voting 
        board members.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Are your youth 
        involved in the governance of The Spot?</b></i></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes. Our youth are 
        intimately involved in every aspect of The Spot. From rules issues to 
        programming changes. We now have two full voting youth participant board 
        members (see <a href="/general_info/board_of_directors.html">Board of Directors</a> 
        page).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Are there 
        other questions and answers we should include here? <a href="mailto:Info@TheSpot.org">Email 
        your suggestions</a>!</font></b></font></p>
